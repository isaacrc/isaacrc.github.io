This course introduces students to the mathematical tools at the core of computational neuroscience research. The course aims to familiarize students with topics in linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning, with a heavy emphasis on applications to neurobiology. Lectures on each topic will develop the relevant mathematical background with links to foundational applications in the field. Coursework will focus primarily on problem sets requiring the implementation of models and analyses in Python. The course will equip students with a practical proficiency in various computational methods, including programming skills in data analysis and visualization that are increasingly important to scientific inquiry in general, and neuroscience in particular.
