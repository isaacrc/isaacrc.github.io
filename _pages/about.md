I'm currently a research scholar and lecturer working with [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/) and [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. I completed my PhD with [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College.

My research leverages machine learning models to better understand the neural machinery supporting human communication and cooperation in ecological contexts. I'm currently working on three related topics: (_a_) using deep neural networks as model organisms for cooperative behavior in an artificial ecosystem, (_b_) modeling how information is transmitted from brain to brain via spoken narratives, and (_c_) developing resources for a more community-driven cognitive neuroscience.
