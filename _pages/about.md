I'm currently a postdoc in [Uri Hasson's lab](https://www.hassonlab.com/) at
the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. I completed my PhD in [Jim Haxby's lab](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College.

My research uses naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms and computational methods to investigate how our brains understand the world. Currently, Iâ€™m working on three related topics: (_a_) modeling shared and idiosyncratic information across individual brains; (_b_) the neural machinery supporting action understanding; and (_c_) how we use language to construct narratives and transmit our brain states to others.
