## NEU 314: Mathematical Tools for Neuroscience [`website`](https://snastase.github.io/teaching/neu314)

This lecture course introduces students to the mathematical tools at the core of computational neuroscience research. A primary goal of the course is to familiarize students to key concepts from linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning, with an emphasis on practical applications and programming. Lectures on each topic will develop the relevant mathematical background and link to foundational applications in the field. The course will include problem sets requiring programming in Python. No prior programming experience is required, but it will certainly be helpful.
