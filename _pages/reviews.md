When solicited for peer review by academic journals&mdash;*if the authors have posted a public preprint*&mdash;I try to post an open review (on [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/)). I send the same review to the journal (usually signed) at the same time as posting the review. You can read more about the motivation for [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00079) and an accessible [article](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/rogue-neuroscientist-mission-hack-peer-review/) by *Wired* magazine.

### Open review of preprint by DuPre and colleagues on [`PubPeer`](https://pubpeer.com/publications/764D03ED6F80183031E5378AC5C365#1)
> DuPre and colleagues provide a timely open science perspective on the logistical challenges for data (and stimulus!) sharing in naturalistic neuroimaging. They highlight tools developed to address these challenges, and provide a useful index of current shared naturalistic imaging datasets. In general, I think the article will make a great contribution to the special issue. My main suggestion is that I think the article (coming from authoritative authors on this topic) could be a little more prescriptive. Three important audiences for this piece are: (1) labs collecting naturalistic data and considering sharing; (2) labs looking to analyze shared naturalistic data; (3) institutional leadership. All three would benefit from any concrete recommendations as to best practices the authors would be willing to make. I provide a handful of comments and suggestions—to be considered at the authors’ discretion given the limited scope of the article.<br>

### Open review of preprint by Hudson and colleagues on [`PubPeer`](>https://pubpeer.com/publications/D986D186184B83B6CB32D3DF3C2B2E#1)
> Hudson and colleagues use two horror movies to explore the relationship between brain responses and behavioral fear variables (sustained and acute fear) in a naturalistic context. I’m not an expert in affective processing or fear circuitry, so I’ll generally limit my comments to methods and some interpretational issues. Their general results are, for the most part, consistent across both movies (two separate samples of subjects), which certainly increases confidence. Several analytic choices, however, are not sufficiently motivated. I’m also unsure how to interpret these results with regard to head motion and physiological variables, both of which may be highly stimulus-correlated (the term “jump scare” makes me cringe in the context of fMRI). Finally, some of the interpretations are overly speculative and need to be re-written to minimize speculative reverse inference. I detail these larger-scale concerns first, then provide a list of minor comments.
