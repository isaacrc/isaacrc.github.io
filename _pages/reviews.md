Open review of *PsyArXiv* preprint by DuPre and colleagues on [`PubPeer`](https://pubpeer.com/publications/764D03ED6F80183031E5378AC5C365#1):
> DuPre and colleagues provide a timely open science perspective on the logistical challenges for data (and stimulus!) sharing in naturalistic neuroimaging. They highlight tools developed to address these challenges, and provide a useful index of current shared naturalistic imaging datasets. In general, I think the article will make a great contribution to the special issue. My main suggestion is that I think the article (coming from authoritative authors on this topic) could be a little more prescriptive. Three important audiences for this piece are: (1) labs collecting naturalistic data and considering sharing; (2) labs looking to analyze shared naturalistic data; (3) institutional leadership. All three would benefit from any concrete recommendations as to best practices the authors would be willing to make. I provide a handful of comments and suggestions—to be considered at the authors’ discretion given the limited scope of the article.<br>
