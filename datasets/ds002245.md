The "Narratives" collection aggregates fMRI datasets acquired over the course of seven years (2011&ndash;2018) while participants listened spoken stories. In aggregate, participants listened to 28 diverse stories ranging from ~3 too ~56 minutes for a total of ~5 hours of unique audio stimuli. The collection includes 315 unique subjects participating in over 750 functional scans with accompanying anatomical data. Data are organized into a machine-readable format according to the BIDS standard with exhaustive metadata derived from the original DICOMs. Anonymized subject labels are linked across sessions and include demographic and behavioral variables including age, gender, condition, and comprehension score. Auditory stimuli are included in the dataset for non-commercial scholarly research&mdash;principally feature extraction&mdash;under *fair use* or *fair dealing* provisions. The data collection amounts to over 350,000 functional volumes of story-listening fMRI data and accompanying stimuli, totaling ~150 hours or 6.2 days. The scripts used to collate and process these data are available at the [*GitHub repository*](https://github.com/snastase/narratives/). The public data release is accompanied by a data descriptor paper currently in preparation:
